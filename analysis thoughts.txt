analysis thoughts

trying to do the process 0 setup efficiently. is it more efficient to have one process atoi the arguments and
distribute them to the other processes or for all processes to atoi the args, since they all have access to the
arguments anyway? 
another thing is that the allocation of the initial and previous board seems unneccesary since we immediately
do another allocation for each process's local boards. we could probably just init a board randomly for each process,
although the way im currently doing it is more oriented towards distributing preseeded boards
